Description: Provides a way to interface with the Ceres Solver (http://ceres-solver.org/index.html) library. Ceres Solver is a C++ library open source C++ library for modeling and solving large, complicated optimization problems. It can be used to solve Non-linear Least Squares problems with bounds constraints and general unconstrained optimization problems. It is a mature, feature rich, and performant library that has been used in production at Google since 2010. This package provides a way to interface with optimization routines in Ceres via R.
